##  Previsão de Preços de Imóveis

This repository contains a machine learning project for predicting real estate prices using historical data and various property features. The project is developed in Python and leverages data analysis, feature engineering, and regression modeling techniques to estimate property values.

## Overview
Real estate price prediction is a critical task for buyers, sellers, and real estate professionals. This project aims to estimate property prices by analyzing historical data and extracting meaningful features from it. The resulting model provides insights into property valuation and helps in decision-making for investments.

## Main Features

- **Data Preprocessing: Cleans and prepares raw real estate data for modeling.
- **Feature Engineering: Extracts and constructs features such as location, size, and property attributes that are essential for accurate predictions.
- **Regression Models: Implements machine learning regression algorithms (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest) to predict property prices.
- **Model Evaluation: Uses metrics like RMSE and R² to evaluate and compare model performance.
- **Data Visualization: Visualizes data distributions, correlations, and prediction results for better interpretability.

## Technical Details

- **Programming Language: Python
- **Libraries Used:
    - **Pandas for data manipulation.
    - **Scikit-learn for building and evaluating machine learning models.
    - **Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization.
- **Approach: The project involves loading a dataset, preprocessing the data, engineering relevant features, training various regression models, and evaluating them to determine the most effective approach for predicting real estate prices.

## Future Improvements
- **Hyperparameter Tuning: Implement automated tuning methods to optimize model parameters.
- **Advanced Modeling: Experiment with more sophisticated models such as Gradient Boosting Machines or Neural Networks.
- **Feature Expansion: Incorporate additional data sources and features to improve model robustness and accuracy.
- **User Interface: Develop a user-friendly interface for interactive property price predictions.
